Agile Development places a high priority on providing customers with value by attending to their requirements 
and preferences while guarantees that the most important features are produced first and that iterative changes 
are driven by customer feedback by dividing work down into small, manageable tasks. However, it lacks of 
predictability so that project timeframes and outcomes might be difficult to predict with accuracy due to 
Agile iterative and incremental methodology. Stakeholders who need set budgets or timeframes may find this 
unpredictability troublesome. Additionally, planning, coordinating, and communicating take more time and effort 
when using agile frameworks like Scrum. This overhead can take a lot of time, especially for projects with short 
deadlines or small teams
